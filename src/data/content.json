      "Stand up paddling (SUP) is the ultimate workout that combines cardio, strength, power and balance and requires a paddle and a paddleboard. Jacob grew up close to the sea and surrounded by nature and has developed a special connection to water. The ocean is an escape, a place to re-energize, a playground for extreme activities such as wave-surfing and paddleboarding. Jacob has competed in world-class events across the globe numerous times as part of the swedish national team.",
